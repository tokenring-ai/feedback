@token-ring/feedback

Overview

- @token-ring/feedback provides human-in-the-loop feedback utilities for the Token Ring ecosystem. It exposes tools to:
- Ask a human clarifying questions (text or choice-based) and record their response context.
- Present file/content for review in the browser (rendering markdown/HTML/JSON/text) and capture Accept/Reject with
  optional comment, writing accepted content into the repository.
- Preview a React component in the browser and capture Accept/Reject with optional comment, writing the accepted code
  to disk.

Installation
This package is part of the monorepo and is typically consumed by the Token Ring runtime. If you need to depend on it
directly:

- Add dependency: "@token-ring/feedback": "0.1.0"
- Ensure peer packages are available in your workspace and registered in your ServiceRegistry where appropriate:
- @token-ring/registry
- @token-ring/chat
- @token-ring/filesystem
- Additional runtime deps used internally by certain tools:
- express, open (browser launching), marked (markdown rendering), moment-timezone, esbuild (React preview bundling),
  esbuild-plugin-external-global

Tool: askHuman

- File: pkg/feedback/tools/askHuman.ts
- Description: Ask the human a question and log the prompt to the chat. Supports free-text or choice-based responses
  depending on the parameters you pass. Returns a structured object describing the asked question; the humanâ€™s answer is
  expected to be provided via the chat interface.
- Parameters (Zod schema):
- question: string (required)
- choices?: string[]
- Optional. Provide options for single or multiple selection.
- response_type?: "text" | "single" | "multiple"
- Optional. If choices are provided and response_type is omitted, it defaults to "single". If no choices are provided
  and response_type is omitted, it defaults to "text".
- Return shape (type union):
- For textual prompt:
  {
  status: "question_asked_text";
  question: string;
  response_type: "text";
  timestamp: string; // ISO
  message: string; // instruction to provide textual response
  }
- For choices prompt:
  {
  status: "question_asked_choices";
  question: string;
  choices: string[];
  response_type: "single" | "multiple";
  timestamp: string; // ISO
  message: string; // instruction to select an option
  }
- Notes
- If question is missing, the tool logs an error via ChatService and returns an error string.

Usage (askHuman)

import { ServiceRegistry } from "@token-ring/registry";
import ChatService from "@token-ring/chat/ChatService";
import * as askHuman from "@token-ring/feedback/tools/askHuman";

const registry = new ServiceRegistry();
registry.registerService(new ChatService());

// Text question
const resText = await askHuman.execute({ question: "Should we proceed with approach A?" }, registry);

// Multiple choice question
const resChoices = await askHuman.execute({
question: "Pick the target environment",
choices: ["dev", "staging", "prod"],
response_type: "single"
}, registry);

Tool: getFileFeedback

- File: pkg/feedback/tools/getFileFeedback.ts
- Description: Serve a local browser UI to review provided content (text/plain, text/markdown, text/x-markdown,
  text/html, application/json). The user can Accept or Reject with an optional comment. If accepted, the content is
  written to filePath; if rejected, a timestamped .rejected copy alongside filePath is written.
- Parameters (Zod schema):
- filePath: string (required)
- The repository path where content should be stored upon acceptance.
- content: string (required)
- The content to review.
- contentType?: string (default: "text/plain")
- One of e.g. "text/plain", "application/json", "text/markdown", "text/x-markdown", or "text/html". Markdown is
  rendered to HTML; HTML is shown via an iframe; JSON/plain are displayed in a <pre> block.
- Return shape:
  {
  status: "accepted" | "rejected";
  comment?: string;
  filePath?: string; // set when accepted
  rejectedFilePath?: string; // set when rejected (base path used for rejected copy naming)
  }
- Behavior
- Launches a small express server that serves a review UI at a random localhost port and opens it in the system browser
  via open().
- Accept writes content to filePath; Reject writes filePath with a .rejectedYYYYMMDD-HHmmss suffix before the
  extension.
- All key steps are logged via ChatService.
- If filePath or content is missing, logs an error and returns an error string.

Usage (getFileFeedback)

import { ServiceRegistry } from "@token-ring/registry";
import ChatService from "@token-ring/chat/ChatService";
import { FileSystemService } from "@token-ring/filesystem";
import * as getFileFeedback from "@token-ring/feedback/tools/getFileFeedback";

const registry = new ServiceRegistry();
registry.registerService(new ChatService());
registry.registerService(new FileSystemService());

const res = await getFileFeedback.execute({
filePath: "docs/PROPOSAL.md",
content: "# Proposal\n\nThis is a draft.",
contentType: "text/markdown"
}, registry);

Tool: reactFeedback

- File: pkg/feedback/tools/react-feedback.ts
- Description: Bundle and preview a provided React component in the browser, then capture Accept/Reject with an optional
  comment. If accepted, writes the code to the specified file (or a generated name); if rejected, writes a timestamped
  .rejected copy.
- Parameters (Zod schema):
- code: string (required)
- Complete source of the component (JSX/TSX) to preview.
- file?: string
- Optional file path where to write upon acceptance. If omitted, a temporary name is used during preview and the
  accepted content is written to that name in the repository.
- Return shape (union):
- Accepted: { status: "accept"; comment?: string }
- Rejected: { status: "reject" | "rejected"; comment?: string }
- Behavior
- Uses esbuild to bundle the component with externals (react, react-dom, react/jsx-runtime provided via globals),
  serves a simple HTML shell with Accept/Reject and comment field.
- On accept, writes the provided code to file; on reject, writes file with a .rejectedYYYYMMDD-HH:mm suffix.
- Returns the result object and logs the preview URL via ChatService.
- If code is missing, returns an error string.

Usage (reactFeedback)

import { ServiceRegistry } from "@token-ring/registry";
import ChatService from "@token-ring/chat/ChatService";
import { FileSystemService } from "@token-ring/filesystem";
import * as reactFeedback from "@token-ring/feedback/tools/react-feedback";

const registry = new ServiceRegistry();
registry.registerService(new ChatService());
registry.registerService(new FileSystemService());

const code = `export default function Demo(){ return <div>Hello!</div>; }`;
const res = await reactFeedback.execute({ code, file: "components/Demo.tsx" }, registry);

Notes

- These tools presume you register concrete ChatService and FileSystemService instances with your ServiceRegistry so
  they can log and read/write files. The Token Ring runtime typically wires these services for you.
- getFileFeedback renders markdown using marked and opens a temporary HTTP server to host the review UI; ensure
  localhost access is available.
- reactFeedback bundles via esbuild and relies on an HTML shell that exposes React as globals; your component is
  rendered as default export.
